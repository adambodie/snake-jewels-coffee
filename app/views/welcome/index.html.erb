Welcome to Adam's Snakes, Jewels and Coffee Shop, </br>

your pal, a pretty jewel for someone you cherish, or </br>
just a cup of coffee to start your wonderful day.  Why </br>
get such items at three different stores when you can </br>
just come to one place instead? Come to Adam's Snakes, </br>
Jewels and Coffee Shop for all your needs. Check out the </br>
