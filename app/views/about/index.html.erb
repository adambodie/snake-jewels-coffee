	Adam's Snakes, Jewels and Coffee Shop opened in 2013 thanks to the
	vision of our founder, Adam Bodinski. As a child, Adam was always
	fascinated by snakes, owning a couple that he named Gold and Silver, 
	which he raised with the help of his parents, Debbi and Steve.  That
	passion continued well into his teenage years, as he studied snakes
	habitats, eating habits and survival techniques.  It was as a teen
	that Adam decided he wanted to open a snake pet shop that catered to 
	snake lovers like himself, with research skills that made the decision 
	process easy.

	Eventually, Adam graduated with a degree in business from the University of
	Minnesota and became engaged to his wife of many years, Melissa.  It was through
	her that Adam developed his second love, jewels.  Adam became obsessed with
	finding the perfect engagement ring for the woman of his life, even researching
	every statistic possible to man to make sure he found the perfect diamond ring.
	With his wife's passion for jewelry, Adam used this dedication to make sure all 
	his jewels were right for her, from the redness of the Ruby to the greenness of 
	his personal favorite jewel, the Emerald.

	One day, while Adam was enjoying his fine roasted coffee, Adam was sparked with an idea.  What if he started
	a shop that exclusively sold snakes, jewels and coffee in the same store?  It sounded silly at the time, but
	with the support of his wife, Adam turned his passion into a reality, with the only shop that sells only snakes,
	jewels and coffee in the same shop.  After all, why go to three shops when you can go to just one?
